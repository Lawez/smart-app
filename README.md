## Conclusion Summary
# Data Quality & Standardization:
_ The dataset was successfully cleaned and standardized. Date formats, age groups, and gender fields were normalized, enabling reliable analysis across variables.

# Expenditure Analysis:

Lab tests and imaging were the top cost drivers.

Older age groups and certain chronic conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes) were associated with higher total costs.

The most expensive diagnoses were linked to inpatient procedures and long-term care.

# Utilization Patterns:

High service frequency was observed in Q1 and Q4, indicating potential seasonal spikes.

Certain demographics (females 25–45 and males 50+) used services more frequently.

A small set of diagnosis codes drove the majority of visits, especially respiratory and infectious diseases.

# Diagnosis Analysis:

The most common diagnoses included malaria, URIs, and hypertension.

These led to frequent lab tests and prescriptions, increasing service volumes.

Chronic NCDs showed upward trends, indicating a shift in disease burden.

# Geographic Analysis:

Expenditures varied greatly by county. Urban counties had higher costs, but some rural counties showed unexpected spikes—potentially due to over-referrals or access issues.

Disparities in service provision suggest unequal healthcare resource distribution.

# Provider Analysis:

A small number of providers delivered the bulk of services.

Outlier providers were flagged for abnormally high average service costs, requiring further audit or policy intervention.

# Predictive Analytics:

SARIMA and Prophet models performed best, forecasting a gradual rise in costs and utilization over the next 12 months.

The MAPE < 10% in Prophet suggests high forecast reliability for planning.

Seasonal spikes in service demand were clearly captured, especially in early and late-year months.

# Strategic Insights & Recommendations
Cost Optimization: Target high-cost services and outlier providers for cost-containment measures.

Equity: Invest in counties with low service utilization but high disease burden to reduce disparities.

Chronic Disease Management: Strengthen prevention and continuity of care for NCDs.

Forecast Integration: Use the predictive dashboard in budgeting and resource allocation decisions.
